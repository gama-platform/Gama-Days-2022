GAMA days is an International Conference where users and developers of the GAMA modeling and simulation platform have the opportunity to meet, present their work, expose their difficulties, propose enhancements and, more generally, exchange and collaborate on exciting topics related to GAMA!

The gama days are [broadcasted live on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIf4h7zpeBeHrK7GY7HeWojXniBU_6nN-)!

A slack workspace is set up to facilitate exchanges during the conference and give the latest information.
