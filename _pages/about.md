After last year's success, we want to continue building the GAMA community. The GAMA Days 2022 is the second online conference that brings together GAMA users and GAMA developers. 

## About GAMA

Agent-based modeling is nowadays becoming increasingly popular for the study of complex systems. Nevertheless, its use requires significant computer programming work because it requires describing all agents and their behavior in the form of algorithms. The GAMA open-source platform aims to help modelers do this work. This generic platform, which has been developed since 2007 by a consortium of research teams allows the content of a model to be built using a modeling language that is easy to access and simulated. GAMA has experienced significant growth in recent years thanks to its ability to build and simulate large-scale models, including hundreds of thousands of agents and detailed geographic data. It also has advanced 3D visualization tools as well as tools dedicated to the construction of serious games. This platform is now used in many research projects dealing with issues as varied as epidemiology, land-use change, natural or technological risks, natural resource management, and urban mobility.

## Scope of GAMA Days 2022

The GAMA Days serve as a communication hub: it invites platform (or plug-in) developers to present their latest creations and it invites users to show how they use the platform. These exchanges will be an important step towards a better structuring of the GAMA community.

With the aim of bringing together the GAMA community from across the world, we decided to organise the GAMA Days as an online event. A couple of dedicated tools and formats will facilitate communication and make sure to have a conference feeling that is similar to an on-site event:

* The Wonder.me meeting platform allows for natural social interaction. Walk around in the virtual conference room to talk with people nearby, listen a plenary talk, share your model or join a discussion.
* Keynote talks will set the stage and break the ice. Good stuff to talk about in the breaks.
* Virtual coffee breaks are a time dedicated for socialising.
* Open Fora are designed in a way that users get into direct contact with developers, and vice versa.
