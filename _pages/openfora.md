## Model exhibition - Wednesday, 14:00-14:30 

In addition to your presentation, you want to have the chance to show how your model works and discuss it with smaller groups of interested colleagues? Then book a virtual booth space in the Open "Model Exhibition" Forum on Wednesday and prepare for a 10min demonstration. You can show your model in a live mode, or your can prerecord a screencast video. Participants will have the opportunity to stroll around the exhibition and stop by at your booth to see the demo.
