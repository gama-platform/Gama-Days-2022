## Elevator pitches - Wednesday, 14:00-14:45

Users present their models on 1 slide in 3 minutes. This Open Forum is dedicated to short presentations in an online format, similar to poster sessions as they are known from on-site conferences. 

The "elevator pitch" derives from the situation, where an employee accidentally meets the company's director at the ground floor, waiting for the elevator. The employee wants to pitch an idea to the company, and this is the unique chance to have the director's full attention. He needs to get his message across in exactly 3 minutes, which is the time until the elevator arrives and goes up to the top floor. 

## Meet the developers - Thursday, 14:00-14:45

GAMA developers will be available in booths, where they present cool, advanced or new features that they have developed. Participants can stroll around and visit a booth to get into direct contact with the developer. Feature presentations start every 15 minutes, so developers will repeat their presentations three times.

Our recommendation: scan through the list of presented features and plan ahead, where to go!

## Panel discussion on "models and data" - Friday, 14:00-14:45

The last Open Forum will be dedicated to a panel discussion about models and data.
