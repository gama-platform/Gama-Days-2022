## Elevator pitches - Wednesday, 14:00-14:45

Users present their models with 1 slide in 3 minutes. This Open Forum is dedicated to short presentations in an online format, similar to poster sessions as they are known from on-site conferences. 

Never heard about elevator pitches? Check out the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch){:target="_blank"} for details.

## Meet the developers - Thursday, 14:00-14:45

GAMA developers will be available in booths, where they present cool, advanced or new features that they have developed. Participants can stroll around and visit a booth to get into direct contact with the developer. Feature presentations start every 15 minutes, so developers will repeat their presentations three times.

Our recommendation: scan through the list of presented features and plan ahead, where to go!

## Panel discussion - Friday, 14:00-14:45

The last Open Forum will be dedicated to a panel discussion about models and data.
