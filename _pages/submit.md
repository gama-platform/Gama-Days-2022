Building on last year's success, the GAMA Days 2022 is the 2<sup>nd</sup> conference, where users and developers of the GAMA modeling and simulation platform will have an opportunity to meet, present their work, expose their difficulties, propose enhancements and, more generally, exchange and collaborate on exciting topics related to GAMA!

GAMA Days 2022 seek submissions of abstracts that:

* presents a new **feature** for GAMA, or
* presents a **model** that uses GAMA.

Additionally, presenters can choose, whether they want to: 

* give a (live) **demo** of a GAMA feature or model that is presented in the conference (see [Open Fora](https://gama-platform.org/Gama-Days-2022/openfora/)).

At least one of the authors of each submission is required to register, attend, and present at the conference. 

## Submit an abstract

Submit an abstract with 500 words max. to present a model or a new GAMA feature . Deadline: 10. May, 2022. 

Decide to submit either a presentation only, or a presentation with demonstration. Demonstrations are 10-minute demos of your model in a (live or recorded) session, right after the talk. 

Abstracts need to be formatted according to the document style for Word or Latex: [download style templates](https://gama-platform.org/Gama-Days-2022/Style-GamaDays2022.zip). Please make sure the abstract is formatted accordingly, before you start the submission.
